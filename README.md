If you haven't setup virtualenv, see http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/#virtualenvironments-ref

To fire up the virtual environment, from the root source directory run the following command
    source [environment name]/bin/activate

In my case
    source venv/bin/activate

Then run:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

That should install the latest required dependencies. If you add additional dependencies, run:
     pip freeze > requirements.txt

To add them to the requirements.txt and then commit.
